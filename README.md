# The-Last-Rep-Gym-Website

Andrei Selenskikh, is a good friend of me. I have been training with him for three years during my undergraduate study at NYU.
Andrei's dream is to open a gym called Last Rep Fitness Co. and have a website of it. During my graduate study at Umich, I took 
a webdesign class, and used the final project opportunity to create this website from scratch. 

The color and format choices are constrained by the project standard of the webdesign class. I hope in the future, I could get a chance
to train with Andrei again and perfect this website with him.

The website is deployed with Github: [Click Here](https://kylema000.github.io/The-Last-Rep-Gym-Website/index.html)
