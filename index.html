            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Andrei Selenskikh, the owner of Last Rep Fitness Co, a proud father of two sons, originally born in Russia, 
                built his strong muscles and tough mind in the Russian navy, and has been helping others building better 
                shape and living a healthier life for 16 years after settling in NYC. 

                The spirit of The Last Rep is to treat every rep like the last. Constantly pushing oneself out of the 
                comfort zone relentlessly. It is to believe hard work beats talent and only hard work could bring satisfying 
                results for one. 

                Join the Gym today and bring a change to your life.

    <aside>
        <p>Above Pictures Are Of Andrei Selenskikh. A message from him: Prepare yourself for
            hard work only. Pushing beyond limits. Training out of Comfort Zone. Hard Work Beats
            Genetics. This has been my way of life since I served in the Soviet Union Military in 1989.
            I just got even better since then. Remember: The mind is the most important part of achieving 
            any fitness goal. Mental change always comes before physical change. It always seems impossible 
            until it is done. So you have to push past your perceived limits, push past that point you thought 
            was as far as you can go.
